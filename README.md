# Foundations of watsonx.ai: An Interactive Workshop on the Capabilities of watsonx.ai

Welcome! This workshop gives an introduction to IBM’s generative AI studio watsonx for students interested in data science and AI engineering. 

We will walk through labs 0 and 1 in this workshop. During this time, participants will have the chance to craft creative prompts to different large-language models. In this workshop, we will be using the [IBM Prompt Lab](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx-as-a-service?topic=models-prompt-lab) and running pre-generated code to show how LLMs can be used in different ways.

The second lab will be optional for students interested in working with watsonx through an API. Labs 3-7 are self-guided and explore beyond prompt engineering using LangChain for RAG use cases, finishing with a quick demo of watsonx.ai in Streamlit.

Thanks to Anthony Stevens (apsteven@us.ibm.com) for authoring the lab material.

Please see the agenda below for a high-level overview.

## Hands-on LABs Level 2

This workshop provided a brief introduction to watsonx.ai’s basic features. After completing the labs, participants should gain an understanding of the value of prompt engineering and the process it takes to receive quality outputs from the models. For more information, please checkout labs 3-7. These labs will be conducted locally on your laptop in a virtual environment.
