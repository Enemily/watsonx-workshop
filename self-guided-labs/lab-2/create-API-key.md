## Visit cloud.ibm.com. At the top right, select the `Manage` dropdown, then select `Access (IAM)`.

**Note:** Make sure to save it somewhere in your device upon creation. You will not be able to retrieve it after closing the pop-up! (You can always generate a new key if you did happen to lose it, however).
